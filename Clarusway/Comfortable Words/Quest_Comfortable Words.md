Task : Find out if the given word is "comfortable words" in relation to the ten-finger keyboard use.

A comfortable word is a word which you can type always alternating the hand you type with (assuming you type using a Q-keyboard and use of the ten-fingers standard).
The word will always be a string consisting of only letters from a to z.
Write a program which returns True if it's a comfortable word or False otherwise.

Examples
Given      word	   Desired Output (explanation)
tester	   False   (uses only left-hand fingers)*
polly	   False   (uses only right-hand fingers)*
clarusway  True    (uses both hand fingers)

*Note : Do a quick research on ten-fingers keyboard usage. (*) the explanation doesn't need to be in the output.
